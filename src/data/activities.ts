      "Embark on an unforgettable journey through pristine forests, alpine meadows, and glacial landscapes.",
    longDescription: `If you are looking for all the best things in one trek, Buran Ghati Trek is for you. Buran Ghati trek starts from Janglik which is approx. 150 km from Shimla. The trail comprises of the dense forest of Oak & Pine trees. The sacred Chandranahan Lake is another attraction of Buran Ghati Trek. The glacial lake remains frozen for the most part of the year. The flowers & herbs are in plenty along the trail. The beauty of numerous glistening streams of water will keep you amazed. The fruit trees are in abundance near Barua village. The fruits grown in this part are apples, pears, apricot & peaches. Buran Pass altitude is 15059 ft. The panoramic view from Buran Pass is one of the best you can get. The trail after the pass is a straight wall where you have to slide for the most part of it. This bit can be technical at times & rope may be required for ascending down the considerably straight face of ice. The trek is recommended for people who have done at least one multi-day Himalayan trek.`,

      "Discover the hidden gem of the Chandranahan Lake Trek, a lesser-known adventure steeped in mythological, historical, and geographical significance, offering unmatched beauty and cultural allure.",
    longDescription: `Chandranahan lake trek is known to a handful of people as its not high on the popularity charts when compared with treks like Kedarkantha, Dayara Bugyal, and more. But, don’t make the mistake of thinking that it is any less adventurous, fun, or appealing in comparison to those mentioned here. Now, Chandranahan lake is not just like any other lakes but it has historical, mythological, and geographical significance as well.  It is believed that Chandranahan lake’s location is the exact place where Goddess Kali used to stay, back in the day, and is also known as her holy abode. Adding to that, it is also the birthplace of  Devta Shikru Maharaj, who holds a very important place in the eyes of locals and devotees. The name of this place has an interesting story as well. And according to the legend, it says that Chandra Dev visits this place for a ritual bath every 10 years. This is why the place is called Chandra-Nahan meaning, Bath of Chandra.`,

    longDescription: `The Pin Parvati Pass trek is unquestionably one of the most enthralling trans-Himalayan treks. This challenging and strenuous trail is only for seasoned and physically fit hikers who have completed at least two, if not three, high Himalayan multi-day camping treks. Spiti’s trans-Himalayan valleys were once difficult to reach, but the Pin Parvati pass path cuts the gap between the Kullu and Spiti valleys in half. The trail was first opened to hikers in 1993. Despite the fact that the trek is strenuous and difficult, the region’s beauty makes it one of the most common Trans-Himalayan treks.`,

                      The trail begins with a sharp descent until we hit the riverbed. Post this, it is a moderate climb all the way up to Nakthan which is an even smaller settlement. It accommodates close to 20-30 households with a few options of refreshments and snacks if you want to fill your tummies for the trek ahead. The village sits to the left of the roaring Parvati River and lies at a halfway mark on the trail to Kheerganga. Bordered by neatly laid out rows of apple trees on both sides of the village along with the variety of colours bursting out from the flora in and around the village, this tiny settlement is nothing if not refreshing. This is the landscape we follow all the way to Rudranag Temple. The Rudranag temple is 30 minutes from Nakhtan village and gets its name from the serpent-like waterfall near the temple.
                      Soak in the beauty of the place, for from here on, it is a steep climb up to Kheerganga. From Rudranag, we cross the wooden bridge over to the other side of the fierce Parvati River and follow the well-marked trail all the way to Kheerganga. 
                      A lot of streams that need crossing welcome you all through the trail. It is not overly strenuous though, for there are plenty of rest points all the way to the campsite for the day. Kheerganga is a small colony of temporary tent shelters. It’s bang in the middle of a massive meadow with a hot water spring just by your tents. If you decide to jump into this pool of warmth to take a bath, know that it is likely to be your last during this entire trip!`,

This wide open land sees the merging of these many water bodies and is a marvel to witness. From Mini Mantalai, to get to the campsite for today, we now have to make a steep ascent of close to 300M which is manageable to negotiate.

On reaching the spur, the trail eases up a bit with gradual ascent until we hit the moraine section of the climb. The moraine section is only a kilometer but takes the longest time to traverse through. It is a fairly steep climb made much more difficult by the rocky terrain.

As the day starts to go up, the ice becomes unstable and hence much harder to walk on. Take one good look at the lush Parvati Valley before we bid it adieu to emerge in the cold desert of Spiti Valley. Today requires negotiating long distances on glaciers. It would serve well to exercise caution and to keep very close to your fellow climbers. Don’t be surprised if you chance upon a few open and many hidden crevasses which can prove to be extremely dangerous. On crossing the glacier, the last bit to get to the pass is a steep climb of close to 300-400M.

The next section is tricky as you reach the snow patches at the base of the waterfall. This is when your snow equipments like trekking pole and ice-axe would come into play. The trek on snow is particularly challenging as the trail is steep and narrow in many sections. This continues for the next 1.5 kms before you reach the meadow at the top.",

                      One, so we can reach as early as possible and give our bodies enough rest for what’s coming the next day. And, two, roads on the mountains are unpredictable and it is always better to account for delays when we start. It is also better to reach before it gets dark.
                      The drive to Kafnu takes you on scenic mountain roads. The struggle of the soft round curves lulling you to sleep while you try to stay awake to soak in the views of the valley is real!

We rest and relax at the campsite, recharging our batteries for the climb to Hampta Pass the next day. Tents would be used for the night."

          `The time we leave today will be determined by the weather and trail conditions, but it will most likely be between 5 and 6 a.m. Depending on the season and weather conditions, the walk would most likely be partly or entirely on snow. We start from the camp with a steep scree slope climb to a ridge, then continue climbing towards another ridge that leads to the pass. This climb will take roughly 4-5 hours, and you will be rewarded with breathtaking views all around. The landscape is totally dominated by the Indrasan and Deotibba peaks, and the ranges towards Lahaul appear to be very majestic. The Siagoru campsite is also by the riverside. Spiti can also be seen from this vantage point. You'll arrive at the bottom of the valley, which will take you to Siagoru, in around an hour and a half. The valley is surrounded by snow-capped mountains, and Siagoru's path is the only accessible side. On flat ground, the trek to Siagoru is easy. We will set your camps on the grounds and retire for the night with a feeling of contentment at the heart.`

It's a pleasant descent from Siagoru. The path follows the side of the river valley between mountain ranges once more. Chatru can be found from a long distance. The sterile mountains are devoid of trees. The tricky part is yet to come. You must exercise caution because the trail can sometimes lead you to the edges of mountains and ridges. There are also some slick sections on the route. To go any further, you must be sure-footed and navigate carefully. You'll find the Chandra River flowing below you, as well as a road that runs alongside it. After that, there are more than two glaciers to climb. Chatru, the next camping zone, is on the other side of the Glacier. Choose a spot with a river flowing through it. The three passes, Hampta, Rohtang, and Spiti, have come together to form Chatru, a magnificent camping spot. It will take about two hours to get to the destination."

    longDescription: `A springboard for hardcore mountaineering, Friendship Peak runs in some influential circles. Nestled comfortably in between all the biggies from the two major ranges - Pir Panjal and the Dhauladhar, Friendship Peak is an amphitheater for the tallest mountains in both these ranges. With a bird’s eye view of Manali from the col, to the mountain ranges in Lahaul from its peak; Friendship peak faces Hanuman Tibba on the one side and finds as its neighbours, giants such as Indrasan, Deo Tibba, Priyadarshani, the Seven Sisters to name a few. The Friendship Peak trek is more than just a pretty view from the top. Standing tall at 5289 M, it falls in the largest range of the Lesser Himalayas - the Pir Panjal. Apart from humbly standing its ground in the midst of the 6000ers, we especially are in awe of the trail of the trek which takes us through the most mesmerizing visuals. We encounter alpine meadows, thick forests and wide clearings, crossings over icy cold mountain streams - and of course a thick bed of shimmering white snow - all packed in 34 kms. It has stunning campsites full of local wildlife and bursts of colors, waiting to be wandered and explored.  Even the landscape buried under a thick sheet of snow is anything but wearisome to look at. `,

About the fact that IMF lists Friendship Peak as a trekking peak, the current procedure developed by IMF in the Manali area requires that the team have an intimation as well as copies of all participants' and guide's ID proofs. For trekking in the upper Himalayan stretches, the IMF has established a regional office in Manali. We'll require two more licences, one from BRO and the other from SDM, once we receive this intimation from the IMF regional office. Only these two permits are required to drive on the road between Solang Nala and Dhundi. If we do not get these two permits, we will hike from Solang Nala to Dhundi, a 7-kilometer walk along the river's edge.

The main attraction of the trail is the old yet dynamic mountain features which resemble a unique pattern of being under the sea for a long time & houses some of the unique fossils. The trail has vast meadows which were a grazing ground for horses from Spiti Valley. The most amazing part of the trek is the walk along the Tso Moriri Lake for complete 2 days where the lake offers different shades of blue with many unclimbed peaks in the background.

It is known as the place where the famous saint Maharishi Bhrigu sat in deep meditation. However, we believe the lake is not the only thing the trek has to offer. You must do the Bhrigu Lake trek for its grasslands.To enter an alpine meadow in our country, one has to often spend at least a day or two trekking within the tree line. We are talking about two or three days of hard ascent. This is because most alpine meadows start at around 11,000 ft above the treeline. However, on this trek, you are in the meadows within the first 10 minutes of this trek! Imagine having meadows such as these right in your backyard. No wonder we go gaga over landscapes that are seen in places like Switzerland.`,

The summit day, when you must ascend up to 1200 metres in one day to reach the mountain, is the most difficult task on the Kang Yatse 2 Trek.

Continue going for another 2-3 hours till you arrive in Chalak settlement. It's nestled between the barley fields, with the mountains in the distance. Have another cup of tea to re-energize yourself for the remainder of the journey. The next camping spot is at Markha village, which is around 5-6 kilometres away. Despite this, the steep ascent to Markha Valley will take 2-3 hours. ",

        description: "Get up bright and early, because today's hike will be a breeze. The approaching path crosses streams and the Markha river multiple times, providing a welcome break from the heat. Umlung hamlet is a small settlement on the road that may be identified by buildings and a monastery. After Umlung, the Kang Yatse mountain emerges into view and continues to beckon you! The next brief break place will be Hankar village. The Tacha monastery, which has been cleverly positioned at such a height, can be seen.",

          "This is going to be a short day full with shocks. Kang Yatse is getting closer and closer. The hike is a gentle 700-meter elevation that takes 3-4 hours to complete. On the way, you'll come across Mystic Mani stones with prayer inscriptions. Recite the devotional prayers and wish for an amazing peak. You will be greeted by twin Tigu lakes. Despite their small size, these lakes mirror the beautiful Kang Yatse mountain. The trails lead to a vast plain of Nimling, where sheep, mountain goats, and occasionally rabbits graze. Nimling is known for its grazing pastures and will also serve as your camping location. The overall set-up is really lovely and provides an opportunity for contemplation.",

          "This is the shortest trekking day of the entire journey. As a result, relax and try to appreciate the beauty that surrounds you. The first part of the walk is difficult due to unstable rocks, but the breathtaking vistas of Kang Yatse will make it worthwhile. The route descends in the second half. At 5,100 metres, you will arrive at your base camp after 2-3 hours. To acclimate, stay out of the tent as much as possible. At the campsite, try not to overwork your body and relax. This is the finest time to examine the mountains in your immediate vicinity and attempt to capture as much as possible.",

Our experts will provide instruction on how to use technological equipment. You'll learn how to walk on the snow, how to use crampons, how to use an ice axe, and other essential skills for the summit attempt. Try to absorb as much as possible. Try not to become too exhausted while doing so, as the next day will be the summit day. The lovely Kang Yatse mountain will be starring at you the entire time. You might also go for a hike in the area to gain height. Make sure your body gets enough rest before attempting the peak. Keep your summit day backpack minimal and simple to carry. ",

For the difficult hike, bring a packed lunch, drinks, and plenty of water. You'll be climbing straight up from 5100 metres to 6200 metres today. As a result, mental toughness is essential. The top is reached through the famed Kang Yatse shoulder. The walk begins with scree and crumbly moraine. It's tough to keep one's foot on the route due to loose rocks. Assist yourself with a hiking pole. The approach upwards features crevasses that are frequently covered in snow. ",
