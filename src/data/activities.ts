    longDescription: `If you are looking for all the best things in one trek, Buran Ghati Trek is for you. Buran Ghati trek starts from Janglik which is approx. 150 km from Shimla. The trail comprises of the dense forest of Oak & Pine trees. The sacred Chandranahan Lake is another attraction of Buran Ghati Trek. The glacial lake remains frozen for the most part of the year. The flowers & herbs are in plenty along the trail. The beauty of numerous glistening streams of water will keep you amazed. The fruit trees are in abundance near Barua village. The fruits grown in this part are apples, pears, apricot & peaches. Buran Pass altitude is 15059 ft. The panoramic view from Buran Pass is one of the best you can get. The trail after the pass is a straight wall where you have to slide for the most part of it. This bit can be technical at times & rope may be required for ascending down the considerably straight face of ice. The trek is recommended for people who have done at least one multi-day Himalayan trek.`,

    longDescription: `Chandranahan lake trek is known to a handful of people as its not high on the popularity charts when compared with treks like Kedarkantha, Dayara Bugyal, and more. But, don’t make the mistake of thinking that it is any less adventurous, fun, or appealing in comparison to those mentioned here. Now, Chandranahan lake is not just like any other lakes but it has historical, mythological, and geographical significance as well.  It is believed that Chandranahan lake’s location is the exact place where Goddess Kali used to stay, back in the day, and is also known as her holy abode. Adding to that, it is also the birthplace of  Devta Shikru Maharaj, who holds a very important place in the eyes of locals and devotees. The name of this place has an interesting story as well. And according to the legend, it says that Chandra Dev visits this place for a ritual bath every 10 years. This is why the place is called Chandra-Nahan meaning, Bath of Chandra.`,

        description: `Kalga is a charming little village in Parvati Valley in the Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh. This beautiful establishment doubles up as the trail head for the popular Kheerganga trek which sees a lot of tourists each year. It also serves as a trail head for this trek.
                      The trail begins with a sharp descent until we hit the riverbed. Post this, it is a moderate climb all the way up to Nakthan which is an even smaller settlement. It accommodates close to 20-30 households with a few options of refreshments and snacks if you want to fill your tummies for the trek ahead. The village sits to the left of the roaring Parvati River and lies at a halfway mark on the trail to Kheerganga. Bordered by neatly laid out rows of apple trees on both sides of the village along with the variety of colours bursting out from the flora in and around the village, this tiny settlement is nothing if not refreshing. This is the landscape we follow all the way to Rudranag Temple. The Rudranag temple is 30 minutes from Nakhtan village and gets its name from the serpent-like waterfall near the temple.
                      Soak in the beauty of the place, for from here on, it is a steep climb up to Kheerganga. From Rudranag, we cross the wooden bridge over to the other side of the fierce Parvati River and follow the well-marked trail all the way to Kheerganga. 
                      A lot of streams that need crossing welcome you all through the trail. It is not overly strenuous though, for there are plenty of rest points all the way to the campsite for the day. Kheerganga is a small colony of temporary tent shelters. It’s bang in the middle of a massive meadow with a hot water spring just by your tents. If you decide to jump into this pool of warmth to take a bath, know that it is likely to be your last during this entire trip!`,

It takes you through dense forests. More than the climb itself, there is a higher likelihood of delay to get to the campsite because of the picturesque landscape which might demand frequent and long halts just to soak all the beauty in. It is commonplace to chance upon families living in these thick forests going about their lives as you navigate your way through the trail.",

It tends to get a bit precarious because of the possibility of landslides. Since we are now slowly moving towards the end of the tree line, the terrain starts to get a bit rocky – it would serve you well to exercise caution on this section.

Halfway to our destination today, we get to a place called Mini Mantalai which is a junction for all the thousands of tiny streams which have made their way to this vast expense from different directions. This wide open land sees the merging of these many water bodies and is a marvel to witness. From Mini Mantalai, to get to the campsite for today, we now have to make a steep ascent of close to 300M which is manageable to negotiate. On the other side of the ascent lies the glacial lake, Mantalai – our campsite for the day on the banks of the lake surrounded by the mighty Himalayas.",

At the start, the trail is a bit muddy with large sections of loose scree which require extreme caution to be navigated. Once this section is crossed, we begin the long and hard ascent for the day. On reaching the spur, the trail eases up a bit with gradual ascent until we hit the moraine section of the climb. The moraine section is only a kilometer but takes the longest time to traverse through. It is a fairly steep climb made much more difficult by the rocky terrain. On reaching the campsite, it won’t be long before you realize that we are camping on the edge of the Parvati glacier.

As the day starts to go up, the ice becomes unstable and hence much harder to walk on. Take one good look at the lush Parvati Valley before we bid it adieu to emerge in the cold desert of Spiti Valley. Today requires negotiating long distances on glaciers. It would serve well to exercise caution and to keep very close to your fellow climbers. Don’t be surprised if you chance upon a few open and many hidden crevasses which can prove to be extremely dangerous. On crossing the glacier, the last bit to get to the pass is a steep climb of close to 300-400M. This climb will take you straight to the top of the pass which gives you a glimpse into the two distinct valleys - the Parvati valley to one side and the Pin Valley on the other.",
