      "Embark on an unforgettable journey through pristine forests, alpine meadows, and glacial landscapes.",
    longDescription: `If you are looking for all the best things in one trek, Buran Ghati Trek is for you. Buran Ghati trek starts from Janglik which is approx. 150 km from Shimla. The trail comprises of the dense forest of Oak & Pine trees. The sacred Chandranahan Lake is another attraction of Buran Ghati Trek. The glacial lake remains frozen for the most part of the year. The flowers & herbs are in plenty along the trail. The beauty of numerous glistening streams of water will keep you amazed. The fruit trees are in abundance near Barua village. The fruits grown in this part are apples, pears, apricot & peaches. Buran Pass altitude is 15059 ft. The panoramic view from Buran Pass is one of the best you can get. The trail after the pass is a straight wall where you have to slide for the most part of it. This bit can be technical at times & rope may be required for ascending down the considerably straight face of ice. The trek is recommended for people who have done at least one multi-day Himalayan trek.`,

      "Discover the hidden gem of the Chandranahan Lake Trek, a lesser-known adventure steeped in mythological, historical, and geographical significance, offering unmatched beauty and cultural allure.",
    longDescription: `Chandranahan lake trek is known to a handful of people as its not high on the popularity charts when compared with treks like Kedarkantha, Dayara Bugyal, and more. But, don’t make the mistake of thinking that it is any less adventurous, fun, or appealing in comparison to those mentioned here. Now, Chandranahan lake is not just like any other lakes but it has historical, mythological, and geographical significance as well.  It is believed that Chandranahan lake’s location is the exact place where Goddess Kali used to stay, back in the day, and is also known as her holy abode. Adding to that, it is also the birthplace of  Devta Shikru Maharaj, who holds a very important place in the eyes of locals and devotees. The name of this place has an interesting story as well. And according to the legend, it says that Chandra Dev visits this place for a ritual bath every 10 years. This is why the place is called Chandra-Nahan meaning, Bath of Chandra.`,

    longDescription: `The Pin Parvati Pass trek is unquestionably one of the most enthralling trans-Himalayan treks. This challenging and strenuous trail is only for seasoned and physically fit hikers who have completed at least two, if not three, high Himalayan multi-day camping treks. Spiti’s trans-Himalayan valleys were once difficult to reach, but the Pin Parvati pass path cuts the gap between the Kullu and Spiti valleys in half. The trail was first opened to hikers in 1993. Despite the fact that the trek is strenuous and difficult, the region’s beauty makes it one of the most common Trans-Himalayan treks.`,

        description: `Kalga is a charming little village in Parvati Valley in the Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh. This beautiful establishment doubles up as the trail head for the popular Kheerganga trek which sees a lot of tourists each year. It also serves as a trail head for this trek.
                      The trail begins with a sharp descent until we hit the riverbed. Post this, it is a moderate climb all the way up to Nakthan which is an even smaller settlement. It accommodates close to 20-30 households with a few options of refreshments and snacks if you want to fill your tummies for the trek ahead. The village sits to the left of the roaring Parvati River and lies at a halfway mark on the trail to Kheerganga. Bordered by neatly laid out rows of apple trees on both sides of the village along with the variety of colours bursting out from the flora in and around the village, this tiny settlement is nothing if not refreshing. This is the landscape we follow all the way to Rudranag Temple. The Rudranag temple is 30 minutes from Nakhtan village and gets its name from the serpent-like waterfall near the temple.
                      Soak in the beauty of the place, for from here on, it is a steep climb up to Kheerganga. From Rudranag, we cross the wooden bridge over to the other side of the fierce Parvati River and follow the well-marked trail all the way to Kheerganga. 
                      A lot of streams that need crossing welcome you all through the trail. It is not overly strenuous though, for there are plenty of rest points all the way to the campsite for the day. Kheerganga is a small colony of temporary tent shelters. It’s bang in the middle of a massive meadow with a hot water spring just by your tents. If you decide to jump into this pool of warmth to take a bath, know that it is likely to be your last during this entire trip!`,

Take one good look at the lush Parvati Valley before we bid it adieu to emerge in the cold desert of Spiti Valley. Today requires negotiating long distances on glaciers. It would serve well to exercise caution and to keep very close to your fellow climbers. Don’t be surprised if you chance upon a few open and many hidden crevasses which can prove to be extremely dangerous. On crossing the glacier, the last bit to get to the pass is a steep climb of close to 300-400M.

    longDescription: `Stretching over 65 kilometres between the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, Rupin Pass is undeniably one of the Grandest Cross-Over Treks of India. Every turn on the trail feels like a giant theatre curtain unfurling, revealing dramatic landscapes drenched in a mindboggling array of colors leaving you dumbstruck in its wake. Be it a hike through thick pine and rhododendron forests or meandering through a hanging village, crossing giant glacial valleys or trudging through the narrow and steep gully of Rupin Pass, glissading down snow chutes to Ronti Gad or making your way  to the top of a waterfall, there is never a dull moment once you are on the trail! Climbing to an altitude of 4,650 M, the Rupin Pass is a moderate level trek perfect for trekkers who have done an easy trek previously & are looking to step up their trekking game. Although the distances covered each day are reasonable and the altitude gain on the trek is relatively steady, the trail does present some challenges demanding a unique skillset to navigate its terrain efficiently. Some Challenges of Rupin Pass Trek is that It is not only the landscape that undergoes multitudes of transformation. The Rupin River in itself changes avatars as we move from campsite to campsite. If we had to pick one, this would perhaps be our most favourite feature of the trek. What makes it special is that you get to trek from the riverbed in Dhaula all the way to the top of the Rupin Waterfall! Not many can claim to have witnessed the course of a river as intimately as one does on the Rupin Pass Trek! The best time to do Rupin Pass is May - June, and September - October.`,

You will get to see the spectacular mountain ranges covered in snow and several streams running down through them merging into the Rupin river and disappearing below your feet. While everyone has seen a waterfall closely, only a few can claim to have seen it right from the top and observe it fall down right into the valley. You will one of those lucky few. Capture this moment at the most cinematic location one can imagine. This campsite is a true sight to behold.",

        description: `This is perhaps the longest and the most thrilling day of the trek. We begin as early as 5 AM and carry packed lunch and breakfast along to reenergize ourselves on the way. The challenges begin to appear shortly after we begin the trek. The ascent to Rati Pheri is a steep incline veering through snow and gains a generous amount of altitude in an hour. The trail climbs over a ridge before reaching the campsite of Rati Pheri. 
          he landscape changes beautifully at Rati Pheri – a promise best kept by the Rupin Pass trek! The expansive views of the Rupin valley are replaced by the alpine Dhauladar range as you now move ahead over vast snowfields. Your trek leader will provide you with appropriate snow equipments such as microspikes and gaiters depending upon the level and density of snow on the trail. From Rati Pheri, the trek is steep and quite demanding as the snow makes it difficult to trudge through. It is slipper in some sections, while at others the snow may be knee-deep demanding every ounce of your energy to take that next step. All the snow techniques you have learnt so far are put to test and how so. In about 3.5 hours, you will finally reach the base of the Rupin Pass gully. Take some time to rest and rejuvenate for the gruelling trek ahead.
          The Rupin Pass gully is a narrow and steep half tube in the mountain side that is prone to lose stones falling over. It stretches over 200 m and would take anywhere between 40 minutes to 1 hour to cover, depending upon the level of snow and the speed of the trekkers.
          After a long and steep icy-climb, the sight of the saddle shaped Rupin Pass cutting its way through the Dhauladar Ranges rewards you with a feeling of pure bliss and euphoria. Hundreds of stone cairns and colourful prayer flags adorn the ridge line that offers impressive views of the Kinner kailash range in the north and the Rupin valley in the south. Spend some time at the ridge and relish the eternal glory of the spectacle in front of you.
          The next phase of the trek steps up the fun quotient by a notch or three. To reach the Ronti Gad campsite, you get to glissade down the chutes of snow. The descent is sharp and rapid and sliding down the snow slope is the best way to cover the distance.
          The slopes even out, after the steep descent, making for an easy walk. Once you cross snowline, be prepared for another sharp descent that leads you to an endless meadow with a stream flowing gently through the mountains. This is the Ronti Gad Campsite. You will be camping here for the night in the vicinity of the towering snow-capped mountains – yet another pleasant change in the landscape around. `,

You may come across mule traffic and shepherds tending to their cattle along the way. Almost 2 hours into the trek, you will see the Ronti Gad valley retreating slowly behind you and the trail ahead opening up to first glimpses of the snow-clad Kinner Kailash range. The sight is an absolute marvel to behold. Soon afterwards, you will see the first signs of civilization afar in the tiny village of Sangla Kanda. Take a quick break in the Sangla Kanda village and have a hot cup of tea to give yourself some respite from the sharp descent.
          The trail from Sangla Kanda to Sangla veers through blue pine forests that come as a refreshing surprise. The trek gradient is a rapid decline over a broad well-defined path going through terraced farms, apple orchards and old stone houses.
          As you finally reach Sangla, take one last look at the giant mountains around and bid adieu to one of the finest cross-over treks of the country. We will reach Shimla late at night, so make your hotel reservations accordingly`,

          The day starts early. Everyone assembles at the meeting point by 7 in the morning so we can start our long drive up to Kafnu – a charming hamlet in the Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh. Although there’s nothing more on the agenda for today other than the 10-hour drive, it is better to leave as early as possible for two reasons:
          One, so we can reach as early as possible and give our bodies enough rest for what’s coming the next day. And, two, roads on the mountains are unpredictable and it is always better to account for delays when we start. It is also better to reach before it gets dark.
          The drive to Kafnu takes you on scenic mountain roads. The struggle of the soft round curves lulling you to sleep while you try to stay awake to soak in the views of the valley is real! With a cluster of brightly colored roofs every few seconds, the houses standing on narrow ledges on mountain faces and the patterns of step farming make the green landscape seem even more pleasing. The murky Sutlej River seems to camouflage itself in its rocky background but its forceful march forward, almost with a sense of resolve, gives it away.
          The roads run narrow in many parts with a deep gorge on the other side leaving the area prone to rock fall and landslides; do not expect this to be a smooth ride.  In some areas, the roads look like they are straight out of Need for Speed – smooth but narrow, under hanging boulders on top of a high mountain with a drop on the other side. A few patches in the last 20 kms of the drive are not concrete; these sections take a lot of time to navigate. After crossing the Wangtoo, bridge, which is the last 1 hour of the drive, the expansive views of Kinnaur Ranges make themselves available for your viewing. The mountains in this region are distinct. They are made up of large chunks of rocks resting one on top of the other – much like a stack of Jenga 15 minutes into the game.
          At the end of the trail of this back-breaking journey will be a warm, wooden homestay with cozy rooms, waiting for you. Expect to reach latest by 7 PM.
          After a small round of introductions, briefing about the trek and what to expect on it, everyone has dinner, settles into their rooms and calls it a day – latest by 10 PM.

For the first three hours, we walk on a motorable road in the vicinity of the Janglik Range while a turquoise Bhaba river cascades alongside us, in the opposite direction. With its sharp turns and high falls, the river is a constant source of energy all through the trek today. It consistently cheers you on with its roaring sound.
          Just 15 minutes into the trek, we start seeing thick layers of old snow forming snouts for the river. The challenge for today is the length of the walk. We will be gaining an altitude of close to 900 M over the span of 10 kms. This means it is going to be a long but steady incline with ample plain patches and patches of slight descend which give you enough time to get your heartbeat back to normal and maintain your pace.
          Be prepared for multiple river crossings on bridges made by unsupported logs placed next to each other. If you have a fear of water, things could already start to get interesting for you. Within two hours of the trek, we would have already covered 400 M of the climb with just 500 M more to go. By 12 in the noon, we enter the door of the forest. Halfway through the day, we would be walking in the woods. Half an hour into our walk, we station ourselves under the shade of the sky-high trees to have the packed lunch we were given at the beginning of the day.
          Post lunch, we continue on into the forest, navigating big boulders and mushy land. After an hour, we will encounter a patch of sharp descent where we lose a little height and by around 2:30 PM, we would have reached vast open meadows with the tallest ferns you have ever seen. It feels good to be under the sun once again after having walked through a forest with a closed canopy. The first campsite is not far from here. As you keep walking straight into the meadows and the land opens up around you even more, you can already see the tents far into the distance. The Bhaba river distributes itself in little streams all through the floor of the lush green meadows.
          Expect to make it to the campsite by 3 PM. Mulling is a beautiful, bovine rich campsite with horses and trees all around your tents. Scattered colors paint the ground in the form of wild flowers and the river flows by your feet. It would serve you well to soak in the view since this campsite marks the end of the tree line for the trail.
          After some stretching and briefing, you will be served hot soup/tea and then you are free to explore this magnificent landscape till dinner time at 07:30 PM. It is important to get some rest after dinner since this is your first night in a tent and at a higher altitude. Give your body some time to adapt to the change in external conditions so it is better able to carry you through to the last day.`,

          There are two major challenges we will be encountering on the way. One is crossing over the forceful river which requires team work, a little technique and soaking your feet in the gushing flow of the icy cold water. The next is a 300 M sharp ascent which is a little tiring, especially because of the weight on our backs.
          Post a rejuvenating yoga session and a warm breakfast, we begin the trek at 10 AM. Today’s route has us follow the river upstream through vast open meadows. There is a clear trail which leads you to the next campsite.
          The first half hour is a straight walk in the meadows which leads to a slight climb to get into the forest area. After 15 mins of ascent, you are literally ‘in the woods’ – suddenly everything is darker and chillier till you cross the forested area across the stream and onto the other side of the mountain. The climb today involves navigating a lot of huge boulders. Other than some tricky sections, these boulders actually aid the hike, proving to be like a climb up the stairs. While you struggle to continuously shift your weight on the big rocks, do not forget to look up and watch out for the magnificent cloud shadows on the barren dips in the mountain faces creating a beautiful play of dark and light shades of green. The wild flowers in the meadows here are a deep yellow and the fairest shade of purple scattered across the valley like spilt beans. We spend the next few hours zigzagging through the mountain across meadows on a gradual uphill climb and reach the campsite by 02:30 PM. The last bit of the hike today involves dipping your feet once again in glacial water in order to reach the warm sanctuary of our tents. Oh! and some mucky land too!
          As soon as you are done stretching, you will find hot lunch waiting for you in your dining tents! You can enjoy your lunch with the snowclad mountains much closer to you than before. Save your plates from the sheep grazing across the meadows at your campsite – they might be in the mood for something spicy!`,

It is a hard day for the legs – firstly because of the steep ascent and secondly because the trek starts with multiple river crossings. We have to cross the streams crisscrossing through the meadows. Because the force of the water is high, this will require rolling up your pants and getting to work as a team in order to successfully make it to the other side. There are around 6 streams to cross to make it to the dry land on the other side – that is thirty straight minutes of bone-chilling water adventure. 
          All this as the green, rocky mountains look at us struggle to keep our feet dry. The cloudless sky makes the tall mountains look almost 2 dimensional against the solid blue of the clear skies.
          Once out of the freezing water, we start to notice other colors and forms getting added to the landscape around us. The color palette of the meadows here is much richer than it was yesterday.
          This is followed by 60 minutes of steep incline. After sections of glacial walking, which require extreme caution and balance, we hit another slice of steep incline for the next 40 minutes. There is also a small water source here after which we hit a precarious section of the trek- a narrow trail which rests on loose rocks with a drop into the valley on the other side. This section needs to be crossed very carefully. It is important to move continuously on sections like these because standing in one place could result in loose rocks slipping down taking you with them.
          Beyond this point, you enter the land of meadows lying alongside glaciers. It is a sight to behold not just for the frenzy of colors but for the marvel of the coexistence of extreme cold and life in the form of summer flowers. There are a lot of small sections of glacier crossing today. After a slight climb, we reach the campsite called Lower Pushtirang. When there is excess snow, this is where we camp. In case the snow has receded, we continue on for 20 more minutes to reach Upper Pushtirang. Expect to reach here by 02:30 PM.
          After stretching, we get ready for tea and then the disbursement of equipment. For our next day, we will need microspikes and gaiters to be able to cross the snow-loaded pass. Expect knee deep snow while crossing the pass. After each of us checks the equipment and learns how to use it, we have an early dinner by 06:30 PM.

          Day 5 starts a little after midnight. Wake up at 2 AM, pack our bags, put all our gear on, have some light breakfast, pick up our bag and off we go, by 03:00 AM! The night is really cold here, remember to layer up accordingly.
          Before we begin, the trek leaders will allot a specific sequence for the trekkers. The slowest person of the group remains in front and everyone else is lined up accordingly. This is to ensure we stay together as a group so as to battle the perils of a night climb together. Remember to bring your head torch for the trek.
          There are no water sources for the next 6-7 hours; so do remember to fill all your water bottles before you leave camp.
          The climb is interesting from the get-go. From the minute we put one foot behind the other, we find ourselves navigating big boulders on a steep incline – traversing through a zigzagging path on a loose mountain. The climb up is likely to take anywhere between 5-6 hours. Expect to reach the pass by 9 AM. The 6 hours of ascent is riddled with precarious sections teeming with rock fall, glacier crossing, scree, moraine and navigating big boulders – all in the dark of the night.
          At 5, as the birds come alive, remember to look up and witness the pastel glow of the sky at the crack of dawn. The soft hues slowly get deeper as the snow-clad mountain tops become a resting place for the rising sun. The crack of dawn presents a panoramic view of the Kinnaur, the Spiti and the Janglik Ranges with snow patches rolling down mountain faces like sweat.
          The climb now gets steeper and more difficult. Once the rock and scree area end, we are presented with an endless sheet of white snow. Here is when we put our microspikes and gaiters on to start our traverse on snow.
          The view from the pass, which is the highest point of the trek at 4,915 M, is nothing short of spectacular. The prayer flags, the panoramic view with the assault of greens on the one side and browns on the other, while you find yourself in knee deep white (snow), is an experience like no other. It is your passage between two distinct worlds - that from the abundant and alive Bhaba valley in Kinnaur to the dry, resilient and almost galactic Pin Valley in Spiti.
          We spend thirty minutes at the pass and then start our descent. You start to appreciate the ascend when you hit the slopes to go down. The snow now starts to get slushy and hence a little more difficult to walk on. If you are lucky and there is enough hard snow, we will be able to cover a lot of distance by sliding down the icy slopes.
          The change is terrain is so stark, it’s mindboggling. We have now entered the Pin Valley on the Spiti side of Himachal. You are invited to the barren landscape with hundreds of shades of browns and dirty red. The Pin River now adorns this landscape flowing calmly through sun tanned rocks. It is a long trail; expect a lot of rocks and dust for the lack of vegetation. 
          You will meet the end of snow by the time we arrive for lunch – by 01: 30 PM. The trail now takes you alongside the blue Pin River. The trail is pretty straightforward. There are some sections which are tricky though, with very narrow trails, deep gorges and loose mountains. Slipping on these slopes will take you straight down into the strong flow of the river. Although, called the cold desert, it is not devoid of color and you learn to see beauty in elements other than the flora of the mountains. From the lip of the valley you look down on the confluence of three rivers at Tiyaand, a trail junction. The land is rich in medicinal plants, and colorful shrubs spilling out of the barren land – a strong, pleasant smell from these assortment of exotic plants follows you all throughout. You will meet patches of snow all through till you reach the campsite. 
          It has been a long day. Stretch yourself and lounge in the sun to cool your body off for a bit. After we serve our stomachs, we hit the bed early because we need to cover a long distance the next day as well – although not as perilous.`,

        description: `Today we head on from Baldar to Mudh Village through Pharka Village. The walk is long but is fairly straight; not very stressful. With no rush, we leave after a hot breakfast at 10 AM. We will get packed lunch today.
          The walk today does not involve too many ups and downs but it does have a few river crossings over log bridges without ropes – but we are sure after all these days, you’d have conquered your fear of water, if any. Within 40 minutes of the trek, we start to see our destination for the day – Mudh Village – far into the distance. There are small patches of steep, narrow, muddy trails which need to be crossed cautiously.
          With the colors of the earth, spilling out of its dry cracks in the form of tufts and a strong smell of the herbs following you on the trail like a stalker, we stop for lunch near water. Our destination is not too far from here.
          There are two major obstacles between you and the village:
          A 30 M long swinging bridge over the Spiti river. This almost unwarranted bridge, dangling between two mountains with nothing but two strings to support it, will bring back all the dizziness of the last 5 days.
          A 20 minute, extremely steep climb to get to this tiny mountain habitation rife with cafes and homestays.
          Expect to reach the village by 03:30 PM. After you explore the peculiar mountain culture and are done introducing your taste buds to their local Himalayan cuisine, we hit the road again, this time to drive two hours to the town of Kaza. This is where we end our trail for the trek. Expect to reach Kaza late evening. Do remember to book your accommodation in this town before you lose network at the beginning of the trek. 
          Kaza is the largest township and a commercial hub of the Spiti valley. Famous for its monasteries and local shopping, there are a lot of small hamlets close to Kaza, for you to explore. A window into how people co-exist with the exotic wildlife of the terrain, their peculiar houses, lifestyle and means of livelihood in this barren land are every bit as fascinating as the trail for the trek.
          To head out of Kaza, you can either hire private cabs or look into local buses. It is a good idea to arrange for your transport on this day in case you are planning to leave from kaza the next day. 
          You can also book Kaza to Manali transport with us. Please refer the transport add on section for the extra cost.`,

It’s a complete trek with its contrasting landscape of flowers, waterfalls, streams, and forests of Kullu valley on one side and a vast expanse of dry and desolate mountains of the Lahaul valley on the other. The journey comprises of 5 days and 22 km with minimal ascends and descends, mild showers, and a surprising change in scenery. In the first two days of the journey, we are accompanied by the gorgeous Rani nallah. On the third day, after a few exciting river crossings, we start ascending towards the pass which is nestled at a height of 4,200 meters. The trek finally ends at the charming high altitude lake that goes by the name of Chandra Tal lake. This turquoise blue lake is situated at a height of 4,250 meters and is best known for its serenity and splendor. The ideal time to do this trek is from June to October when the magic of monsoon rains give life to a wide pallet of flowers and colours.`,

The 16 kilometers of drive which takes up to 1 hour takes us through sharp curves and bends. Three kilometers from the Manali bus stand, the roads gain height and lead towards the mountains through Prini. As we gain height, we witness the massive Beas River flowing through the vibrant Manali city in the valley below us. The view of Manali soon fades as we drive forward and a stream of smooth clouds envelope the massive landscape around us. While driving through the clouds we can see huge pine and small apple trees accompanying us on both sides of the road. An hour later, we reach Jobra which is situated right next to the famous Allain Duhangan Hydropower Plant.
          Trek from Jobra (2,743M) to Chikka (3,048M)

This day is easy as we cover a distance of 3 kilometers in 2 hours. After a few minutes into the trail, small streams of the Rani nalllah accompany us on our left. Then, we cross a rustic wooden bridge and continue walking beneath the trees for the next 1.5 km. At the end of the forest line, the trail opens up to the valley towards Chikka. From here, the path gradually ascends and is lined with moist logs and boulders on either side. After 2 kilometers, the landscape reveals its many surprises. There are small flowers and shrubs alongside the river and horses by the dozen grazing through the shrubs in free spirit. Our first campsite of the trek, Chikka, is at the end of this elevation (about 3 kms from here).`

A little further into the trail, the flow of Rani nallah changes towards the right-hand side. There’s something very refreshing about water bouncing off the small boulders lined along the stream, its sprinkles hitting us in the face taking away the fatigue that comes with walking on the trail. We experience the first river crossing of the trek after 2.5 kilometers. This river crossing is a gateway to the colorful meadows of Jwara, a huge stretch packed with flowers that boast of all the hues of the colour spectrum. Lunch break at Jwara is equivalent to a picnic at a park. The trail from Jwara gets easy with minimal ascends and runs closer to the river. It turns completely flat 4 kms from here. On the right-hand side of the track, you can spot small pockets of land between the water stream with unusual orchids and small birds.

After a while, the valley opens up and a huge frame of the river runs parallel with us. When we cross 2 kilometers, the trails get steeper and steeper with heavy ascents and turns. The higher we climb, the thinner the river becomes. The last source of fresh water and greenery ends at the 3km mark and a dry trail of snow and rock begins. The path on the snow is vigorous and the weather is likely to be unpredictable for the next kilometer. Hampta Pass lies at the end of this trail. The pass is a small stretch that leads us to Lahaul. The trails directly descend with a 50-degree steep slope from the pass. This descent continues for the next 3 km.

Nestled comfortably in between all the biggies from the two major ranges - Pir Panjal and the Dhauladhar, Friendship Peak is an amphitheater for the tallest mountains in both these ranges. With a bird’s eye view of Manali from the col, to the mountain ranges in Lahaul from its peak; Friendship peak faces Hanuman Tibba on the one side and finds as its neighbours, giants such as Indrasan, Deo Tibba, Priyadarshani, the Seven Sisters to name a few. The Friendship Peak trek is more than just a pretty view from the top. Standing tall at 5289 M, it falls in the largest range of the Lesser Himalayas - the Pir Panjal. Apart from humbly standing its ground in the midst of the 6000ers, we especially are in awe of the trail of the trek which takes us through the most mesmerizing visuals. We encounter alpine meadows, thick forests and wide clearings, crossings over icy cold mountain streams - and of course a thick bed of shimmering white snow - all packed in 34 kms. It has stunning campsites full of local wildlife and bursts of colors, waiting to be wandered and explored.  Even the landscape buried under a thick sheet of snow is anything but wearisome to look at. `,

If these permits are not secured, the team will need to cover the 7-kilometer distance between Solang Nala and Dhundi on foot, following a scenic path along the riverbank.

    longDescription: `Parang La trek is an ancient trade route between the Spiti in Himachal, Tibet & Changthang in Ladakh region. Parang La trek can be started from either Karzok village in Leh or from Chicham / Kibber village in Spiti. The trail takes you to a maximum altitude of around 5600 meters to Parang La & follows the Pare Chu river which goes to Tibet & re-enters India. The main attraction of the trail is the old yet dynamic mountain features which resemble a unique pattern of being under the sea for a long time & houses some of the unique fossils. The trail has vast meadows which were a grazing ground for horses from Spiti Valley. The most amazing part of the trek is the walk along the Tso Moriri Lake for complete 2 days where the lake offers different shades of blue with many unclimbed peaks in the background. The endpoint is Karzok village which houses one of the old & powerful monasteries in Leh.`,

You must do the Bhrigu Lake trek for its grasslands.To enter an alpine meadow in our country, one has to often spend at least a day or two trekking within the tree line. We are talking about two or three days of hard ascent. This is because most alpine meadows start at around 11,000 ft above the treeline. However, on this trek, you are in the meadows within the first 10 minutes of this trek! Imagine having meadows such as these right in your backyard.

            Bhrigu Lake rests between two high-altitude ridges. You begin with hiking to the first ridge, which is an hour away. In June, the trail is usually covered in snow. In July, as the snow melts on the lower reaches, you see the trail slowly turning from green to brown and white. As you reach the ridge, look for an oval glacial lake in the distance. Depending on the season, the lake is either surrounded by snow or fresh grass, along with alpine flowers.
            "If you climb over the ridge on the side of Bhrigu Lake and look down, you see the three campsites of Hampta Pass trek - Chikha, Jwara, and Balu ka Ghera -  laid out in front of you. But be careful as you climb over the ridge. From the edge, it is a nerve-wracking steep drop into the valley," says Arjun Majumdar, Founder and CEO.
            On a clear day, you can catch a stunning panoramic view of the Pir Pinjal and Dhauladhar ranges. Also, major peaks such as Indrasen, Deo Tibba and Hanuman Tibba stand majestically before you. The lake is normally enveloped in fog which can make finding the route tricky.

      "The Kang Yatse 2 Trek in Ladakh is a thrilling high-altitude adventure, taking trekkers to 6,250 meters in the heart of the Himalayas, offering raw beauty, challenging ascents, and breathtaking views of the Ladakh landscape.",
    longDescription: `Kang Yatse 2 is one of the highest trekkable mountains in India’s Ladakh area, with a height of 6250 metres (20,600 feet). The Kang Yatse 2 mountain is located in Hemis National Park, near Stok town, some 15 kilometres southwest of Leh, Ladakh’s capital. Kang Yatse stands out from the rest of the Markha Valley’s peaks. Even the fittest and most experienced hikers will find the height, terrain, and grade of the ascent challenging. It provides a raw experience of the Ladakh Himalayas, despite the snow and cold. It is slightly higher than Europe’s tallest peak, Mt. Elbrus, at 18,510 feet, and Africa’s highest mountain, Mt. Kilimanjaro, at 19,340 feet. The summit day, when you must ascend up to 1200 metres in one day to reach the mountain, is the most difficult task on the Kang Yatse 2 Trek. Trekkers must begin their journey to the peak about midnight and fight the cold to reach the top`,

Because Leh is already at an altitude of 11,000 feet, you should be fully acclimatised. Take advantage of this day to recover and acclimate your body to the high altitudes. In Leh, there is good phone reception. This day can be used to shop for last-minute items or to hire equipment. Smoking and drinking should be avoided at all costs. You can sleep for the day if you arrive late. You may also go about and become acquainted with the culture. The cultural riches, monasteries, castles, and temples of Leh are well-known.",

The Shey Palace, Thiksey Monastery, and ThikseyGompa will transport you to Leh's past. Thousands of adventure seekers or tourists may be found in Leh during peak season. To obtain a feel for the culture, try to interact with everyone. Leh is well-known for its cafés and hangout spots. You are welcome to try them if you so choose. Again, alcohol and smoking should be avoided at all costs. Aside from its cultural legacy, Leh is known for its passes and lakes, including as Nubra Valley and Pangong Lake. We do not allow trekkers to go to such sites on their own. This is to prevent putting unnecessary effort on the body, which might stymie the acclimatisation process. As a result, avoid relocating to higher elevations and instead walk to neighbouring locations. Have a good time at the hotel."

As you go along your own path, you'll pass by the quiet and lively Magnetic Hill. You will reach the confluence of the Zanskar and Indus rivers over sights of colour shifting rocks and parched grasslands. Chilling is a prominent Leh town that serves as a base camp for winter Chadar expeditions and summer river rafting. The journey begins with a difficult rise via the Zingchen Gorge. At Kaya-Do, you will also be able to cross the river on a trolley. The path crosses the Indus River several times. Skiu will be the first time tent camping has been done. It's near the junction of the Shgri Nala and Markha rivers. There are around 10-15 dwellings in the village. They're also great for tea breaks and homestays. There is also a historic monastery in the environment. End the first day of your walk at Skui, excited for the adventures ahead."

Today is your chance to see the Markha Valley. This will be the longest day of hiking, with a total distance of 20 kilometres. On this somewhat lengthy day, you will be greeted by three to four communities and their revitalising hot tea. Harding, the first such settlement, is reached after 2 hours of climbing. Continue going for another 2-3 hours till you arrive in Chalak settlement. It's nestled between the barley fields, with the mountains in the distance. Have another cup of tea to re-energize yourself for the remainder of the journey. The next camping spot is at Markha village, which is around 5-6 kilometres away. Despite this, the steep ascent to Markha Valley will take 2-3 hours. The Markha river has a strong stream, and you'll have to cross it. Depending on the amount of snowfall, the river level might reach knee height. Because it includes roughly 30-40 dwellings, the Markha valley is considered the largest. There are remnants of a fort for anyone interested in history. There is also an old monastery, which is said to have been erected in the 1800s. Walking through the village and interacting with the residents while sipping hot tea is a must."

The next brief break place will be Hankar village. The Tacha monastery, which has been cleverly positioned at such a height, can be seen. Hankar also serves as a camping ground where visitors may spend the night. From Hankar, follow the well-marked route to a stone bridge. There are several exits, yet you continue on the same road.

Despite their small size, these lakes mirror the beautiful Kang Yatse mountain. The trails lead to a vast plain of Nimling, where sheep, mountain goats, and occasionally rabbits graze.

Try not to become too exhausted while doing so, as the next day will be the summit day. The lovely Kang Yatse mountain will be starring at you the entire time. You might also go for a hike in the area to gain height. Make sure your body gets enough rest before attempting the peak. Keep your summit day backpack minimal and simple to carry.

For the difficult hike, bring a packed lunch, drinks, and plenty of water. You'll be climbing straight up from 5100 metres to 6200 metres today. As a result, mental toughness is essential. The top is reached through the famed Kang Yatse shoulder. The walk begins with scree and crumbly moraine. It's tough to keep one's foot on the route due to loose rocks. Assist yourself with a hiking pole. The approach upwards features crevasses that are frequently covered in snow. You may need to rope up for safety reasons depending on the amount of snowfall. Take caution and keep a close eye on your surroundings. The path follows the northwest ridge to a rocky protrusion on the north face. The 360-degree vistas of the Zanskar range, Karakoram peaks, and mountains around Kang Yatse may be found after a difficult trek to the top. The K2 mountain may possibly be visible (second highest peak in the world). The faraway Tibet mountains may also be visible. The sights are wonderfully satisfying and will restore all of your energy for the descent. The entire peak trail is 5 kilometres long on either side. Be cautious on the scree and moraines as you retrace your tracks. To avoid more weather problems, make sure you return from the summit by 1 p.m. After a hard summit attempt, return to base camp to relax."

Hold your breath at the jaw-dropping sight of the massive K2 Mountain, the world's second tallest peak. Prayer flags are fluttering in the breeze. Surprisingly, the pass provides an excellent network connection. Chokdo is reached after a 5- to 6-hour climb. There is a sharp fall and rough terrain on this route. As you go through the Indus and Ladhak valleys, it will show you the magnificent aspect of the frigid dessert. You will have conflicting emotions today, grief that the walk is coming to an end, and pleasure that you have completed the trek. The beauty of the Indus Valley and the Ladakh range varies dramatically as the trek progresses. This is the final destination on the hike, and it also features a lot of homestays.

The cost of a buffer day is not included in the trek fee; the cost of a buffer day is Rs 4,000 per person and per day.

      "The Annapurna Circuit Trek, hailed as the 'world's greatest trek,' is a 155 km journey through Nepal's diverse landscapes, from lush forests to arid highlands, culminating at the breathtaking Thorang La Pass at 5,416 meters.",
    longDescription: "What The Great Gatsby is to literature, Annapurna Circuit is to trekking – a classic! It is christened as the ‘world’s greatest trek’ with fine reason – a title it’s earned and retained over all these years since the route first opened in 1977. From the highest mountains to the deepest gorges, the longest suspension bridges swaying to the overzealous winds to crossing the most scenic settlements in high mountains with deep valleys, the greenest lands thick with forests to regions as dry as dust and bone – this trek is 155 kms of sheer awe. Starting from the capital city of Nepal, Kathmandu, you are in the middle of giants on touchdown into the country. Following the drama of the Marsyangdi River as it unhesitatingly cuts its way through the Himalayas, the trail takes you through two separate river valleys crossing over from one to the other through the highest point of the trek, Thorang La Pass – which lies at the edge of the Tibetan Plateau at an elevation of 5,416M",

      "The Black Peak Expedition in Uttarakhand's Garhwal region is a thrilling challenge for seasoned mountaineers, ascending to 6,387 meters through glaciers, rugged paths, and stunning alpine vistas, culminating in the iconic cobra-shaped summit of 'Kala Nag.'",
    longDescription: `Nestled in the supernatural mountain ranges of the Garhwal region in Uttarakhand, the Black Peak, also revered as "Kala Nag" by locals, stands as a monumental challenge for avid mountaineers. The mountain's distinct cobra-hood-like appearance and dark shadow cast its mystique across the Saraswati mountain range, which includes other notable peaks such as Saraswati Devi Parvat and Hanuman Parvat. Starting from Sankri, the Black Peak Expedition ascends to a staggering 6,387 m (20,960 feet), traversing through the enchanting Ruinsara Tal and entering a realm of sprawling glaciers and iconic snow ranges like Bandarpoonch and Swargarohini. This journey culminates on the tenth day at Black Peak within the bounds of Govind National Park, a site first conquered by Jack Gibson in 1955.
                      Designed for the experienced trekker, this expedition offers a thrilling and adventurous trek across rugged, rocky, and deserted paths. The journey involves navigating curvy routes with inclines ranging from 60 to 75 degrees, over rivers, and at dizzying heights of over 2000 feet. With no villages or farms post-Ruinsara Tal, trekkers rely entirely on their guides, making it an actual test of endurance and thrill for adventure seekers.`,
